### Hello!

I am a recent graduate with a MS in Physics from TAMUC, where I developed a strong foundation in data analysis and quantitative research. My experience includes hands-on data acquisition and analysis from the TESS satellite, focusing on photometric variability in white dwarfs using Python. My projects in surface physics and statistical modeling have further refined my analytical abilities. I am currently learning about AI and machine learning, specifically TensorFlow and Xgboost, and exploring various techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, linear and logistic regression, and anomaly detection.
